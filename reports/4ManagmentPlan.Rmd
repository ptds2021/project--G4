# Management Plan

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source(here::here("scripts/setup.R"))
```


For the organisation of our project, we want to create 2 group within us to split the tasks. 

One group will be responsable of the management of "Data Cleaning and Wrangling" and the other group will be responsible of the creation of the "Shiny App" for a better visualization. 

We plan to make weekly zoom or meet in the campus every Friday afternoon to discuss between each other the next steps to follow and analyze everyone's work. 


```{r}

data <- data.frame("Sophie" = "Data Cleaning/Wrangling",
                   "Team Member" =
                   "Louis" = "Data Cleaning/Wrangling",
                   "Francesco" = "Shiny App Integration",
                   "Daniel" = "Data Cleaning/Wrangling",
                   "Özgür" = "Shiny App Integration")


data %>%
  kbl()%>%
  kable_styling()

```
