We would start from scratch, from an empty page, to create a shiny application using some necessary packages:
such as “shiny”, “shinydashboard” for the construction of the application and some other packages to create 
a dataset visual (such as “DT”), moreover we implement some fancy “ggplot” graphs to facilitate visualizations, 
applying some filters on the data and useful tools to let operators take records in an efficient ways of the quantities.
We have about 1 year data with thousands of observations and some variables about the operator, 
the request numbers, the date, the target weights, and the confidence intervals.
The main source of ispiration of the project is the meeting with Joao Ramalho that explained us his project idea.
