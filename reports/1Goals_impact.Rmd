In the scope of this class, we will be working with Nestle through Joao Ramalho.

Our project would be an application on industrial production area. 
More precisely the final and ambitious objective of the work is to help the Nestle coffee production
creating a shiny application to support the controlling mechanism of the coffee weight during the new capsules recipes formulations.
Since the coffee is an expensive row material, even a little variation in the quantities, taking account of the massive scale of the production,
has an impact on the cost of goods sold of the company; indeed, a control of the weight in that sense could help to optimize such industrial process. 
The application would be used by different users: The operator, that would use the app to control his work. 
The project manager, to check the big picture of the project in the R&D branch of the company.
