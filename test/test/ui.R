More precisely the final and ambitious objective of the work is to help the Nestle coffee production
creating a shiny application to support the controlling mechanism of the coffee weight during the new capsules recipes formulations.
Since the coffee is an expensive row material, even a little variation in the quantities, taking account of the massive scale of the production,
has an impact on the cost of goods sold of the company; indeed, a control of the weight in that sense could help to optimize such industrial process. 
The application would be used by different users: The operator, that would use the app to control his work. 
The project manager, to check the big picture of the project in the R&D branch of the company."),
